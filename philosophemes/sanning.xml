      Truth is one of the central subjects in philosophy. It is also
      one of the largest. Truth has been a topic of discussion in its
      own right for thousands of years. Moreover, a huge variety of
      issues in philosophy relate to truth, either by relying on
      theses about truth, or implying theses about truth.
